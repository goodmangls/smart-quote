## 2. Dashboard

Same as Member dashboard. See [Member User Guide](USER_GUIDE_MEMBER.md#2-dashboard) for widget details.

---

## 3. Admin Quote Calculator

Access via `/admin` (header **Admin** link).

### Key Differences from Member View

1. **Margin Breakdown Visible**: Full cost breakdown including margin percentage, cost amount, and profit
2. **Margin Slider**: Manually adjust target margin percentage at any time
3. **Admin Widgets Panel**: Additional management widgets below the calculator (see sections 4-10)
4. **No Slack Notification**: Admin saves do not trigger Slack alerts

### Calculation Pipeline (Full Visibility)

```
Item Costs → Carrier Costs → FSC → Margin → Final Quote
```

| Stage | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Item Costs | Packing dimensions, volumetric weight, material/labor |
| Carrier Costs | Zone lookup → rate table → billable weight pricing. China Southern (CN-S) uses UPS Z10 |
| FSC | Fuel surcharge % applied to carrier cost |
| Carrier Add-Ons | Auto-detected surcharges (Surge Fee, EAS/RAS, AHS) + manual add-ons |
| Margin | **Markup 방식**: `revenue = cost × (1 + margin%)`, rounded up to nearest KRW 100. 매출 대비 실효 마진율은 명목값보다 낮음 (예: 24% Markup → 19.35%) |
| Warnings | Low margin (<10%), surcharges, collect terms |

### Special Packing Info Panel

When selecting **WOODEN_BOX**, **SKID**, or **VACUUM** packing type, a detailed info panel displays:

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Material Cost | Surface area × ₩15,000/m² |
| Labor Cost | ₩50,000/box standard, ₩75,000 for vacuum (×1.5) |
| Fumigation Fee | ₩30,000 fixed per shipment |
| Dimension Impact | +10 (W) / +10 (L) / +15 (H) cm |
| Weight Impact | Actual weight × 1.1 + 10 kg |
| Estimated Total | Live preview based on current cargo inputs |

> If the cargo triggers AHS (Additional Handling Surcharge), a warning is shown in the panel.

### UPS Surge Fee Auto-Detection

For **Middle East and Israel** destinations, UPS Surge Fee is automatically calculated:

| Region | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Israel (IL) | KRW 4,722/kg + FSC |
| Middle East (15 countries) | KRW 2,004/kg + FSC |

The surge fee appears as a carrier add-on (code: **SGF**) and is included in the carrier cost automatically.

### EAS/RAS Postal Code Auto-Detection

When a destination ZIP code is entered, the system checks against **86 countries and 39,876 postal code ranges**:

- Detects **Extended Area (EAS)**, **Remote Area (RAS)**, or **Delivery Area (DAS)** surcharges
- Shows an orange banner with a one-click **Apply** button
- Maps to **RMT** (Remote) or **EXT** (Extended) add-on codes

### DHL Add-On Services (Expanded)

Six new selectable DHL add-ons are available:

| Code | Name | Amount |
|------|------|--------|
| EMG | Emergency Situation Surcharge | Variable |
| TSD | Trade Sanctions Delivery | ₩50,000 |
| NSC | Non-Stackable Cargo | ₩440,000 |
| MWB | Manual Waybill Entry | ₩15,000 |
| LBI | Lithium Ion Battery | ₩10,000 |
| LBM | Lithium Metal Battery | ₩10,000 |

### Incoterm Policy

> **Note**: UPS/DHL express shipments use **DAP only** — no exceptions.

| **P50** | Nationality | Margin by user nationality (e.g., KR, JP, US) |
| **P0** | Default | Fallback margin when no other rule matches |

Resolution uses **first-match-wins** algorithm with 5-minute cache.

### CRUD Operations

## 14. Troubleshooting

**Q: Margin rules aren't applying to new quotes**

**Q: FSC rates seem outdated**
A: Check the external links in the FSC widget to verify current rates, then update manually if needed.

**Q: A member can't access the dashboard**
A: Verify their account exists in User Management and their role is set to `member`.

**Q: Audit log shows unexpected actions**
A: All admin actions are tracked. Check the user filter to identify who performed the action.

**Q: Surcharge stale warning appears on saved quotes**
A: Surcharge rates have changed since the quote was saved. The customer should request a re-quote.
